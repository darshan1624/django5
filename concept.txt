Django5 
- web framework written in python
- encourgaes rapid development, reusabilty
- follows MVT architecture


Advantages
- Builtin Admin Interface
- ORM (dont have to write raw sql query, can connect any type of db
	postgres, mysql, oracle, mongodb)
- Authentication System (Inbuilt authentication system)
- Security


Django Project 
A group of application is called as Django Project.
e.g.: School Management System(SMS) project may contain
	registeration App, Fees App, Exam App, Result App 

Command to create django project
django-admin startproject StudentManagementSystem . 
// if "." dot is given outer folder wont be created.

File structure in django project
 - __init__.py 
	this file creates folder as package in python
 - wsgi.py  (web server gateway interface)
	acts as a interface between your project and webserver
	this describes how web app will communicate with webserver
 - asgi.py  (asynchonous server gateway interface)
 - settings.py 
	all the settings are done here like allowed host, apps used, 
	middleware, template directory, db connection, timezone, 
	static folder dir, global varaibles
 - urls.py 
	all app urls are metioned here
 - manage.py 
	this file is used to run server, create applications


 __pycache__ 
	this folder gets created when you do runserver. This is 
	created to store cache for faster webpage loading 

Django Application
Command to create app
python manage.py startapp app1

File structure in app
 - migrations 
	this folder contains all migration files 
 - admin.py 
	when we want to show db table in admin panel we reister it here
 - apps.py 
 - models.py 
	models are defined here table structure is created here
 - tests.py 
	unit test are written over here
 - views.py 
	project business logic is written over here

The app to be detected by django project it need to be mentioned
in INSTALLED_APPS = ['app1',]


How to create function based view (in view.py of django app)
from django.http import HttpResponse
def learn_django(request):
	return HttpResponse("Learn Django")

In urls.py of django project
path('learn-django/', views.learn_django, name='learndjango')

Can view local web page at url
http:/127.0.0.1:8000/learn-django


How are urls written ? 
syntax: path('route/', view, kwargs, name)
 kwargs - it is used to pass any arguments to view
 name - it is used for url reversion

kwargs e.g.: 
path('learn-django', views.learn_django, {'status': 'OK'})

def learn_django(request, **kwargs):
	status = kwargs.get('status')
	return HttpResponse(f'<h1> Learn Django {status} </h1>')

// You can metion urls of apps directly in django project where 
 settings.py when its a small project. 
 But when you have mutiple apps its best practice to keeps urls 
 separated and mention in the app itself. So, that this app can be 
 used easily in some another project (hint: sms, teacherManagetSystem)

How to metion different url in app itself?
 (same as we do directly in project urls)
 path('learn-django', views.learn_django, {'status': 'OK'})
 
 For it to work we also need to metion it in project urls.
 from django.urls import path, include
 path('app1/', include('app1.urls'))

url - http:/127.0.0.1:8000/app1/learn-django


How are templates created?
Inside app create teamplates folder and inside teamplates create 
folder with app named again, inside this app folder u can create
.html files.
	app name= course
	course>templates>course>django.html, fastapi.html

How to render template?
In views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

def learn_django(request):
	return render(request, 'course/django.html')


Django Template Language:
How to create dynamic template?
- variables
In views.py
	def learn_django(request):
		coursename = {'cname':'Dajango', 'version':5.0}
		return render(request, 'course/django.html', coursename)

In django.html
<body> <h1> This is a {{cname}} course using {{verison}} version.
	</h1></body>

- filters
dj template provides in built filters on text in HTML.

<body> 
    <h2> Name: {{name|upper}}</h2>    amit: AMIT
    <h2> desc: {{desc|truncatewords:4}} </h2>  This is template code ... 

Multiple pipe filters
    <h2> desc: {{desc|upper|truncatewords:3}} </h2>
</body>

other filters: 
 lower, capfirst, default:'nothing', length, slice, truncatechars:2, 
 floatformat:2


- conditions (if, elif, else, endif)
 context = {'nm' : 'Amit'}
    <h2> If Tag </h2>
	{% if nm %}		
	  <h3> Name: {{nm}} </h3>
	{% endif %}

 Boolean (and, or, not)
 context = {'nm' : 'Amit', 'st': 108}
   	{% if nm and st %}
		<h3> Name: {{nm}}, Seat: {{st}} </h3>
	{% endif %}
 Operators
 	{% if nm == 'Mumbai' and st > 100 %}
		<h3> Seats Full </h3>
	{% elif nm == 'Mumbai' and st > 50 %}
		<h3> Seats Half Full </h3>
	{% else %}
		<h3> Seats available </h3>
	{% endif %}
	
 filter
	{% if nm|length >= 4 %}
		<h3> {{nm}} </h3>
	{% endif %}		

- loops
 context = {'names': ['Amit', 'Anket', 'Oliva', 'Sanket']}
 {% for name in names %}
	<li> {{name}} </li>
 {% endfor %}
 reversed list of names
 {% for name in names reversed %}
	<li> {{name}} </li>
 {% endfor %}


How to access elemnts in nested dict in templates?
stu = {
		'stu1': {'name': 'amit', 'roll': '101'},
		'stu2': {'name': 'anket', 'roll': '102'},
		'stu3': {'name': 'oliva', 'roll': '103'},
		'stu4': {'name': 'sanket', 'roll': '104'},
	}
students = {'student': stu}
context = students 
<h2> {{student}} </h2> ==> entire stu dict is printed
<h2> {{student.stu1}} </h2> ==> 1st dict is printed
<h2> {{student.stu1.name}} </h2> ==> 'amit' name is printed 


context = {'stu1': {'name': 'amit', 'roll': '101'}}
{% for key, value in student.items %}
	{{key}} - {{value}} <br/>
{% endfor %}


How to store static files?
(css, javascript)
To include static files in app, create 
	static>app_name>css> style.css
			>js> script.js
			>images> img.jpeg

when including css, js in html file, you need to load static file first.
{% load static %}
<html >
<head> 
    <link rel='stylesheet' href = "{% static 'app_name/css/style.css'%}">
    <script src="{% static 'app_name/js/script.js'%}"> </script>

</html>


Template Inheritance:
Rather that creating same components like nav, footer in every webpage
we can create it in single .html file and inherit that code in other
.html files.

base.html 
suppose base.html file has all the required components. 
and I want same implemented in home.html
home.html
{% extends 'app_name/base.html' %}

Now suppose base.html has <title> </title> tag which is needed in both
home.html as 'Home Page' and in about.html as 'About Page'.

so, to make it dynamic we provide that specfic input from home.html, 
about.html.

base.html
	..
	<title> {% block title %}  
		{% endblock %}
	</title> 
	..

home.html 
{% extends 'app_name/base.html' %}
{% block title %}  
	Home Page
{% endblock %}

Similar to title we can have other content diff for diff pages.


How to apply css/js/images when implemented template inheritance for
specific pages?
style.css
	body {
		background-color: gray;
	} 
	h1 {
		color:green;
	}

base.html
{% block css %} 
    <link rel='stylesheet' href = "{% static 'app_name/css/style.css'%}">
{% endblock css %} 
	##applying this way it gives default style value to every 
	page
	##if diff is required in some page then can implement this 
	block css.


Hyperlink:
Without hyper link we have to hardcode like below
urls.py
	path('core/', include('core.urls')), 
	path('course/', include('course.urls'))

	inside core app urls.py 
	path('home/', views.home)
	path('about/', views.about)

base.html	
<ul>
	<li> <a href='/core/home'> </a> <li> 
	<li> <a href='/core/about'> </a> <li>
	<li> <a href='/course/django'> </a> <li>
</ul>

Using hyperlink
	path('home/', views.home, name='home')
	path('about/', views.about, name='about')

<ul>
	<li> <a href="{% url 'home'%}">Home</li>
	<li> <a href="{% url 'about'%}">About</li>
	<li> <a href="{% url 'django'%}">Django</li>
</ul>

Just like extends in ineritance we can use include to include 
templates inside another template.
e.g.:
templates/app_name/components/navbar.html

base.html
<body>
{% include 'core/components/navbar.html' %}
{% block content%} {% endblock content %}
{% block footer%} {% endblock footer %}
</body>
	




Object Relational Mapper(ORM):
ORM allows communication between application and database.
Benefits: 
	- You dont need to know sql, oracle, mysql, sqllite to
		 create databse and perform query
	- Can switch to diff db anytime e.g.: from sql, postgres 


model - It is a structure of the table in db.
How to create model?
from django.db import models
class Profile(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
	email = models.EmailField(max_length=200)
	city = models.CharField(max_length=200)
	roll = models.IntegerFied()

migrations - Indetify any change in model and create file for it.
	- we can say, it creates SQL statement to create table.

migrate - It excutes those migratetion files to create table in db.

> python manage.py makemigrations
> python manage.py migrate 


The table that will be created in db will have by default this name
> appname_modelname
e.g.: if app_name = student, model_name = Profile
then, table_name = student_profile 


To view migration files for entire project excute
> python manage.py showmigrations

To view sql command generated in migration file after running 
makemigrations excute
> python manage.py sqlmigrate student 0001
